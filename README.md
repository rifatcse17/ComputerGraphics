ComputerGraphicsCourseMaterials

I've created this repository to place all the task I will complete in the Computer Graphics course on my university. In this read me section, I added the course curriculum that our university provided. I will try to implement all the task as much as possible.
Course code : CSE-4704
Course title : Computer Graphics Sessional

    To perform also other experiments relevant to this course.

Graphics library (graphics.h) installation in codeblocks

    Copy the two files graphics.h and winbgim.h to the location C:\Program Files (x86)\CodeBlocks\MinGW\include (Code::Block default directory).
    Copy the libbgi.a file to the C:\Program Files (x86)\CodeBlocks\MinGW\lib.
    In code::blocks open Settings >> Compiler >> Linker settings and click Add button in link libraries part and browse and select libbgi.a file whick you have just added in step 2.
    In right part (ie. other linker options) paste commands -lbgi -lgdi32 -lcomdlg32 -luuid -loleaut32 -lole32
    Click ok
